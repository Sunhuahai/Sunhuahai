🎓 **Academic Explorer** | 🤖 **ML Enthusiast** | 🌍 **Global Impact Dreamer**

#### 🔭 Currently
- Pursuing my degree at **Tsinghua University** (one of China's most prestigious institutions!), where I immerse myself in cutting-edge research and collaborative innovation.
- Passionate about **Machine Learning**—exploring everything from deep learning architectures to real-world AI applications.

#### 🌱 Learning & Growing
- **ML/DL**: TensorFlow/PyTorch, NLP/CV projects, and AI for social good.
- **Beyond Tech**: Philosophy of AI ethics, interdisciplinary science (neuroscience × AI?), and maybe a bit of quantum computing curiosity!
- **Languages**: Python (❤️), C++, and maybe Rust/Julia on the side.

#### 👯 Collaboration Goals
- **Healing the world with tech**: Interested in AI for healthcare, climate change mitigation, or education equity. Let’s build solutions that matter!
- Open to hackathons, research partnerships, or just geeking out over algorithms.

#### 💡 Fun Stuff
- When not debugging code, I’m probably:
  - 📚 Reading sci-fi (Ted Chiang, anyone?) or books on cognitive science.
  - 🎵 Playing guitar/jamming to indie music.
  - 🌱 Planting herbs on my balcony (tech + nature balance!).
